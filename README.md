This provider helps you define which animations will run when routing to another view.

Prerequisites are angular.js, angular-animate.js, angular-route.js and a css with defined animations.

## More and better documentation to come...


The css animations were copied from <a href="http://dfsq.github.io/ngView-animation-effects/app"> Aliaksandr Astashenkau's demo site</a>.
